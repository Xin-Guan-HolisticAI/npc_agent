You are given a sentence and two noun concepts: concept_1 and concept_2.

In the previous step, you identified both concepts are referential dependent on each other.
That is to judge if it is true that the reference of the concept_1 should only be known if we know the reference of the concept_2 according to the sentence.

According to the definition, there is only one way dependency, meaning that if concept_1 is depends on concept_2, then concept_2 could not depend on concept_1.
Now, you need to judge which dependency is more reasonable.

Return JSON with two keys:
1. "reasoning": Brief analysis
2. "answer"
    - "yes" (if concept_1 is depend on concept_2)
    - "no" (if concept_2 is depend on concept_1)
    - "not sure" (ambiguous relationship)

Format:
{{
  "reasoning": "...",
  "answer": "..."
}}

Here is the input:

sentence: "{sentence}"
concept_1: "{concept_1}"
concept_2: "{concept_2}"
